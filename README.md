## Overview

The n8n+IPGeolocation integration makes it simple to use the full [**IPGeolocation.io**](https://ipgeolocation.io) APIs inside your n8n automation workflows. You do not need to write code or handle API requests because everything can be automated through clear and simple actions.

With this integration, you can quickly get helpful information about any IP address. This includes location details, network ownership, security risk information, user agent data, time zone details, and even basic astronomy information. You can use this data to improve your workflows, personalize user experiences, and make your automations more secure.

It allows you to automate retrieval of:

- Geolocation information for any IP address
- Threat intelligence and security risk details
- Network ownership and ASN information
- Time zone data and time conversion tools
- Astronomy information such as sunrise and sunset
- User agent details including browser, operating system, and device type

## API Key & Connection Setup

To use IPGeolocation.io with **Make**, you need a valid **API Key**. Follow these steps carefully:

### Create or log in to your IPGeolocation.io account

- Go to [IPGeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/).
- If you don’t have an account, click [**Sign Up**](https://app.ipgeolocation.io/signup) and complete the registration.
- If you already have an account, click [**Sign in**](https://app.ipgeolocation.io/login) and enter your credentials.

### Obtain your API Key

- After logging in, go to your [dashboard](https://app.ipgeolocation.io/dashboard).
- Copy your **API Key** — you’ll need it to connect Make with IPGeolocation.io.

### Open Make and create a scenario

- Go to [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and log in or sign up.
- Click + from your sidebar and create a new workflow from scratch.
- You will see a canvas where you can add nodes.

### Add an IPGeolocation node

- Click the **+** button to add a node.
- Search for **IPGeolocation** in the nodes search bar.

### Set up the connection

- Paste the **API Key** you copied earlier into the required field.
- Click **Save** to authenticate the connection.

### Test the connection

- n8n will attempt to connect using your API Key.
- If successful, the module will show a green checkmark and confirmation.

![](https://static.ipgeolocation.io/web-assets/images/integrations/n8n/successful-connection.png)

- If there’s an error, double-check your API Key and make sure it’s active and valid for the plan you’re using.

### Use your connection

- Once connected, this API Key is available for **all IPGeolocation modules** in your n8n workflows.
- You can now use it to perform actions like **Get IP Geolocation**, **Parse User Agent**, or **Bulk IP Geolocation**, depending on your API plan.

## Actions Availability across our Plans

We offer **four API plans**: **Developer**, **Standard**, **Security**, and **Advanced**.

The availability of actions depends on the plan you are subscribed to. The following table provides a detailed overview of which actions are included in each plan, helping you quickly identify the plan that suits your needs.

| **Action** | **Developer** | **Standard** | **Security** | **Advance** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Get IP Geolocation** | ✔ | ✔ | ✖ | ✔ |
| **Get Bulk IP Geolocation** | ✖ | ✔ | ✖ | ✔ |
| **Get IP Security** | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | ✖ |
| **Get Bulk IP Security** | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | ✖ |
| **Get ASN Info** | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ |
| **Get Abuse Contact Info** | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ |
| **Get Astronomy Info** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Get Astronomy Timeseries Information** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Get Timezone Info** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Get Time Conversion** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Get User Agent Info** | ✖ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Get Bulk User Agents Info** | ✖ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |

If you attempt to use **Security-related actions** (for example, **IP Security Lookup**) with an API key from the **Standard plan**, the request will **fail** because these actions are **exclusive to the Security plan**. The API will return an **error message** indicating unauthorized access.
